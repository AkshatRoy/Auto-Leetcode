# Automating LeetCode


This tool automates the process of typing code directly into LeetCode using a Bash script and Python. It pulls questions and corresponding answers from two text files, opens the relevant LeetCode page, and types the solution with proper formatting. Designed to streamline repetitive coding tasks, the tool is flexible, customizable, and can be easily adapted for other use cases.

Note: This project was created to practice automation and scripting, not for cheating.
